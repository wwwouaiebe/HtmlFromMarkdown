# HtmlFromMarkdown

A quick ( but not dirty) tool to transform markdown files into html files

## How to use

From the node command line run:
```
node main.js --src=PathToTheMarkdownFiles
```

where PathToTheMarkdownFiles is a path to the md files

The program  will transform all the markdown files in the directory and subdirectories into html files.

CSS styles can be added in a index.css file that must be in the scr directory
